# Hello!
I'm Tanisha Khurana, an electronics and communication engineer interested in IOT, computer vision and deep learning.  
I love to think about the intersection of both hardware and software and leveraging both to create something useful.  

I care deeply about any ideas that help in the betterment of society and learn more about the world we live in.  

*As a problem-solving enthusiast, I have always been eager to meet new technical challenges, where I can learn some new things and feed my curiosity.  
From noisy sensor output data to images to sequential to spatial data, I have been trying to make sense out of them to create something that has a real world impact.    
As an R&D Engineer, I love to put forward my technical and analytical skills, tackle original problems and learn every day.*
I am currently based in Delhi and I'm always looking for opportunities to work with passionate people on shared goals, whether it be creative, personal or professional projects!
