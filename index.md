I'm Tanisha Khurana, a graduate student in my second year of masters in Electrical Engineering at NC State University. I am specializing in signal processing and computational intelligence.

I am currently working as a Graduate Research Assistant for the Department of Crop and Soil Sciences for [Precision Sustainable Agriculture](https://www.precisionsustainableag.org/){:target="_blank"} under Dr. Chris Reberg-Horton. My work encompass the entire developmental process of [PlantMap-3D](https://www.precisionsustainableag.org/plantmap3d){:target="_blank"}, spanning from the integration of ROS and cameras to the implementation of Semantic Segmentation for identifying plant species. 

I am also doing research under Dr. Edgar Lobaton at [Active Robotics and Sensing Lab](https://research.ece.ncsu.edu/aros/){:target="_blank"} on [Foraminifera Segmentation](https://research.ece.ncsu.edu/aros/foram-identification/){:target="_blank"}

I have more than 3 years of experience in Computer Vision and Machine Learning. I have a strong track record of leading teams and managing entire projects during my tenure at [Wobot.ai](https://wobot.ai/) and [Intello Labs](https://www.intellolabs.com/). I have a deep understanding of computer vision and machine learning and have successfully applied this knowledge to various projects, from object detection and image segmentation to video analysis and facial recognition. 

I have taken courses such as Digital Imaging systems, Digital Signal Processing and Probability and Random Processes strengthening my foundation in signal and image processing.

In addition, I have delved deeper into the field by taking courses in Neural Networks and Deep Learning, Advanced Machine Learning, Detection and Estimation Theory, Pattern Recognition, Cloud Computing, and Natural Language Processing, broadening my knowledge in this domain.

I am currently based in Raleigh, North Carolina and I'm always looking for opportunities to work with passionate people on shared goals, whether it be creative, personal or professional projects!
