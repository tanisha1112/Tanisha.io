# Hello!
I'm Tanisha Khurana, an electronics and communication engineer interested in IOT, computer vision and deep learning.I love to think about the intersection of both hardware and software and leveraging both to create something useful.  

*I have always been eager to meet new technical challenges and gain a deeper understanding to tackle the problem at hand.From noisy sensor output data to images to sequential and spatial data, I have been trying to make sense out of them to create something that has a real world impact.As an R&D Engineer, I love to put forward my technical and analytical skills and learn something new every day.*  

I am currently based in Delhi,India and I'm always looking for opportunities to work with passionate people on shared goals, whether it be creative, personal or professional projects!

# Previous experiences
- **Wobot.ai** :
	I have been working at Wobot since May 2021 as a Computer Vision Research Engineer. We are building a SaaS product to automate process monitoring through CCTV cameras. I have been working on researching new innovative techniques to solve real world use-cases using state-of-the-art models.   

- **Intello Labs** :
	I worked at Intello Labs in the Research and Development team. Intello Labs is an agri-tech startup with an aim to digitalize food quality measurement and reduce food wastage by bringing transparency to the supply chain. I have worked in both hardware and computer vision teams where I was involved in the entire end-to-end framework encompassing from the data collection using video streams from multiple raspberry pi's to annotating images and training deep learning models, to finally delevoping computer vision algorithms to deploying on edge devices.  
	
**Qiggle.ai** : 
	Qiggle was a newly based startup constituting of just 5 members including me. We were developing predictive analytics solutions for industrial applications.I was working as an IOT Engineer to evaluate sensor data, storing and processing data to the cloud and detect anomalies.  
	
**Innefu Labs** :
	At Innefu Labs, I worked on computer vision applications such as security surveillance, weapon detection and even collaborating with Delhi Police to find missing persons using face recognition. I was involved in data acquistion, cleaning and model development.   

**GenElek Technologies** : GenElek Technolgies is a heath-tech startup incubated by Delhi University and supported by STPI, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology. Worked on building robotic exoskeletons to assist specially-abled people (suffering from paralysis, stroke, spinal cord injury (SCI), and other such neurological conditions) to walk or move again.    

**Reliance Jio** : I interned at Relaince Jio in my fourth year of college. I worked on GIS tools like MapInfo Professional 11.5 used for plotting microwave antenna sites and Pathloss 4.0 for microwave radio link designing and planning. Learnt about network operations for Jio antenna coverage across New Delhi area, link budget, EIRP, FSL and maintained reports on the areas of operations in Excel.
