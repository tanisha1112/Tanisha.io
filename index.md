I'm Tanisha Khurana, a graduate student in my final year of masters in Electrical Engineering at NC State University. I am specializing in signal processing and computational intelligence.

I'm currently working as a Graduate Research Assistant for the Department of Crop and Soil Sciences for [Precision Sustainable Agriculture](https://www.precisionsustainableag.org/){:target="_blank"} under Dr. Chris Reberg-Horton. My thesis is on Multi-task learning and Domain Adaptation techniques for Semantic Segmentation & Biomass Composition Estimation. 

I have also worked on the developmental process of [PlantMap-3D](https://www.precisionsustainableag.org/plantmap3d){:target="_blank"} and researched under Dr. Edgar Lobaton at [Active Robotics and Sensing Lab](https://research.ece.ncsu.edu/aros/){:target="_blank"} on [Foraminifera Segmentation](https://research.ece.ncsu.edu/aros/foram-identification/){:target="_blank"}

With over 4 years of experience in Computer Vision and Machine Learning, I possess a strong track record of leading teams and managing entire projects during my tenure at [Wobot.ai](https://wobot.ai/){:target="_blank"} and [Intello Labs](https://www.intellolabs.com/){:target="_blank"}. This experience has allowed me to develop a deep understanding of computer vision and machine learning, which I have successfully applied to various projects, including object detection, image segmentation, video analysis, and facial recognition.

I am currently based in Raleigh, North Carolina and I'm always looking for opportunities to work with passionate people on shared goals, whether it be creative, personal or professional projects!
