**Hello!** 
        I'm Tanisha Khurana, an electrical and computer engineering student at NC state university. I'm interested in computer vision, machine learning and deep learning.   

I am currently based in Raleigh, North Carolina and I'm always looking for opportunities to work with passionate people on shared goals, whether it be creative, personal or professional projects!
