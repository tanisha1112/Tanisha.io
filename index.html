HI!
I'm Tanisha Khurana, an electronics and communication engineer interested in electronics (duh), computer vision, machine learning and deep learning. 
I love to think about the intersection of both hardware and software and leveraging both to create great results. 
This is my portfolio where I try to analyze,visualize and make sense out of data.

I care deeply about any ideas that help in the betterment of society and learn more about the world we live in.
I also like to think of myself as an amateur environmentalist and an avid reader.

~Have a look at my projects and ramblings~
