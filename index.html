<h1> HI!</h1>
<p>I'm Tanisha Khurana, an electronics and communication engineer interested in electronics (duh), computer vision, machine learning and deep learning.
I love to think about the intersection of both hardware and software and leveraging both to create great results.</p>   
<br><b>This is my portfolio where I try to analyze,visualize and make sense out of data.<b></br>
I care deeply about any ideas that help in the betterment of society and learn more about the world we live in.I also like to think of myself as an amateur environmentalist and an avid reader.

<h2>~Have a look at my projects and ramblings~</h2>
