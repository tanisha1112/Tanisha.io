The objective of this project was to incorporate explainable AI (XAI) techniques to gain insights into the interpretability of the model. The project utilizes state-of-the-art XceptionNet architecture to detect deepfakes, and then employs LIME and GradCam algorithms to visualize and analyze how the model interprets the results.

We extracted frames from FaceForensics ++ and CelebDF video dataset and trained the Xceptionet model pretrained on ImageNet weights and were able to achieve an accuracy of 0.99.

The idea of a Laplacian blob detector is to convolve the image with a “blob filter” at multiple scales and look for extrema of filter response in the resulting scale space.

Blob Filter:

This filter generated by double derivating Gaussian filter along x and y-axis and adding them. Above is also known as Laplacian of Gaussian.
The Laplace is the sum of second derivatives (the trace of the Hessian matrix). An image convolved with the LoG is the same as the Laplacian of an image convolved with a Gaussian:

1. a.  Wrote a function to implement g= conv2(f, w, pad), where f is an input image (grey, or RGB), w is a 2-D kernel (e.g., 3 × 3 box filter), and pad represents the 4-padding type clip/zero-padding, wrap around, copy edge, and reflect across edge.

    b.  Created a grey image of size 1024x1024 pixels that consists of a unit impulse at the center of the image (512, 512) and zeros elsewhere. Used this image and a kernel (e.g., selected one from (a)) to confirm that the function is indeed performing convolution. 

2. Implementing and testing the 2-D FFT and its inverse using a built-in 1-D FFT algorithm.

Kalman filter estimates the state of a system with incomplete or noisy information.
* It uses the system model and the measurements to estimate the true state of the system and its uncertainty.
* In this project, I implemented a discrete-time, time-invariant Kalman filter as a MATLAB function.
* For the benchmark case I used the Kalman filter to estimate the position and velocity of a moving object based on noisy measurements of its position.
* Kalman filter will be used to make future predictions using past values to correct the estimated state.

### FFT Implementation in MATLAB

[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/tanisha1112/FFT-Implementation-MATLAB/tree/main#fft-implementation-matlab)

For this assignment, I implemented three functions in MATLAB®:


1. myDFT, a brute-force implementation of the DFT,
2. myFFT_139, a decimation-in-time implementation of the FFT, and
3. "butterfly", a decimation-in-time butterfly called by myFFT_139.
A code listing for these functions is provided in the appendix.
