The objective of this project was to incorporate explainable AI (XAI) techniques to gain insights into the interpretability of the model. The project utilizes state-of-the-art XceptionNet architecture to detect deepfakes, and then employs LIME and GradCam algorithms to visualize and analyze how the model interprets the results.

We extracted frames from FaceForensics ++ and CelebDF video dataset and trained the Xceptionet model pretrained on ImageNet weights and were able to achieve an accuracy of 0.99.
