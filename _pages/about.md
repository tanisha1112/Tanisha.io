**Hi, It's nice to meet you. I'm Tanisha Khurana and I am really passionate about technology and using it for good.**

I am also passionate about volunteering and using my skills for a positive impact. I have been an active member of Omdena, Bhumi, WWF and Greanpeace. 

I was involved in two projects at Omdena:
1. [Modeling Food Web and Forecasting Populations for Endangered Wildlife Species](https://omdena.com/projects/ai-biodiversity/) : I was able to build automated methods that allow for the identification, collection, and sorting of biodiversity food web and population data so as to facilitate the valuation process.  


2. [Helping the Energy Industry Achieve Digital Transformation Through AI](https://omdena.com/projects/energy-transformation/): I collaboratored to help to automatize site schemas in the energy industry building i.e building computer vision models for automating the conversion of the P&ID documents to their digital format. This included detection of different symbols, texts, lines, and their export into computer-readable XML format.

I have developed the following websites for NGO's as part of [Bhumi, India's](https://bhumi.ngo/) , Daan Utsav: A Celebration of Giving initiative.  

1. [Cards NGO ](https://www.cardsngo.org/about/) : 
Community Action for Rural Development Society (CARDS) is a non-governmental, social service organization, centered around the downtrodden and oppressed people of backward villages in Tamil Nadu, India.

1.  [Chaitanya Charitable Trust ](https://chaitanyatrust.org.in/home/) : Chaitanya Charitable Trust is a non-profit, non-government organization (NGO) that works primarily with the slum population in Gujarat, India to improve children’s education. It also works in health & human services, education, women’s empowerment, environment & humanitarian relief.

I have also volunteered at [GreenPeace, India](https://www.greenpeace.org/india/en/) and a member of [WWF, India](https://www.wwfindia.org/). 
I was apart of WWF's Ek prithvi intitative where I collected surveys from school children of grades 6-9. I further automated the data collection process by using Tesseract OCR and conducted data analysis on MS Excel.
