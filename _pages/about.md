Name: Tanisha Khurana   
Date of Birth: 11th December, 1996 (making me 25 years of age)   
Occupation: Computer Vision Engineer    
Location: Delhi, India (Technically Noida but it counts as Delhi, NCR okay!)   
Interests: I love reading books mostly fiction but I really liked the book Life 3.0 by Max Tegmark and The short history of nearly everything by Bill Bryson.   

My favourite book has to be 1984 by George Orwell. 
The deep learning book by Ian Goodfellow,Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville is *chef's kiss* brilliant. One of the most clear and thorough book for the subject. 
Grokking's Deep Learning is also quite good!   
Favourite food: Had to be cheesy fries and pasta. And anything sweet really! A huge dessert lover!
(Also an avid exclaimation mark user!!)

I am also a big supporter of technology for change and a huge nature lover. 

My aim is to build something distruptive and (even if this sounds cliched) make an impact on the society.
